## Follow the #system and the power of #documentation

This is a *template* for working moving forward, to input thoughts and jot down notes daily will create a habit of __thought collection__

The follow flow-list will be continually developed, in hope to find the most optimal way of work for me. 

First, start off with __Journalling__, to annotation or put down thoughts that has inspired me in my daily encounters. These thoughts *should be* plain and simple. Without too much overthinking/ process/ complications. Simply put down the thoughts as a journal.

Second, when these thoughts gather momentum, they go into __Reflection__. Again, reflection does not have to be grandiose. For instance, reflection based on the trip to #Kassel #Documenta could yield more interesting results down the line. But don't worry about results for now. Just add to the reflection in a category.  __Tag and categorize thoughts no matter how trivial these tags might look and sound now__!!

On top of that, every fortnight there should be an entry on things that had happened, thoughts that are gathered. I call that #superjournal The reason for that is to give myself a time to reflect and to relive those important moments, thoughts. Even when there wasn't too many happenings for those two weeks, __superjournal__ will still help document these thoughts. 

When enough thoughts are gathered, or when a specific topic triggers my enthusiasm, we go to  #research phase. Each researches deserves a separate folder. Do not limit on the research topic. This is not #deepresearch yet. One never know what one is going to see if he or she is not looking! **Make sure to CATGORIZE and TAG each thoughts/ info!** (More elaboration #deepresearch down the line)

Simultaneously, #art-making phase begins. Yet, this is also not a full blown art making session. I will take a deeper look at the next phase later. #art-making is essentially experiments. Such experiments can come in two forms: i) start each daily art-making session with a dedicated goal, experiment with this goal and just make away! ii) on days that nothing comes to mind, just make things, write, make music. I will try to eliminate music/ art dichotomy. in-fact, they belong to the same category. 

When an experiment is cool/ call for more attention, it becomes #production. Which means, dedicate more thoughts, more time in the craft. There is no more research here that needs to be researched, no more rhetoric. Rhetoric comes before and after. This is the time to just make things, and make things to their fullest potentially. This is the link that has been missing, there were too many guess works that lingers before even when "producing". I am eliminating those doubts. 

Very importantly, during #superjournal onwards, each step should be documented on Obsidian, Miro, Google Drive. If you have written notes, scan them. Tag each documents with the same tag and perhaps with a little information on the stage of progress.
